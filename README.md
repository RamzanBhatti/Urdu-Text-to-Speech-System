This repository contains the implementation of an Urdu Text-to-Speech (TTS) system developed as part of my Final Year Project (FYP). The project utilizes advanced machine learning models, including Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with Adversarial Learning and Transformer models, to convert written Urdu text into natural-sounding speech.
**Introduction**
This project aims to create a high-quality Urdu Text-to-Speech system by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques. The system is designed to handle the linguistic complexity of the Urdu language and produce realistic speech outputs.
**Features**
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for phoneme and text modeling.
Adversarial Learning to improve speech naturalness.
Transformer models for handling Urdu language syntax and morphology.
Scalable architecture for various applications.
